Both data and code are in MATLAB (tested on version 2018b). Here is a guideline to the files/folders:
- analysis.m: analysis file that reproduces all statistical tests and figures from paper
- data_exptX.mat: the raw data for Experiment X (X=1,2,3)
- helperFunctions: useful functions that are called by the analysis files above

If using these codes, please cite the paper.
